## Boardgame
This is a test and play project. The vast majority of the code was created using ChatGPT Version 4. I may tweak things here and there without asking ChatGPT to make the change if its something simple, but large tracts of code are completely the work of the AI. Should be clear this is a work in progress...and just for fun.

## Origin
I was playing with ChatGPT "Wargames" style, and making it play tic tac toe with itself...was going to move on to Thermonuclear War, but decided to try creating a new game with a little bit of "Tic Tac Toe", little bit of "Go", and maybe a bit of Risk? I dunno. Game rules are fluid right now but are as follows (as of right now)

## Rules

        1. Players take turns placing a piece on the grid.
        2. If a piece is surrounded by an opponent's pieces, it's captured and the player that made the capture gets another turn.
        3. If a player fills a row or column with more than half their pieces they capture all the pieces in that row or column.
        4. The game ends when the entire grid is filled.
        5. The player with the most captured pieces wins!
        
### Requirements
Game currently written in python, and requires pygame (https://www.pygame.org/)
